@KarttunenSasu,You can unconsciously distort your own research data simply by choosing an unscientific colour map. E.g. the popular rainbow/jet artificially highlights features which really aren't there in the data. It's time to #endrainbow and make a move for perceptually uniform colour maps. https://t.co/rn6UMhQnjf,http://twitter.com/KarttunenSasu/status/1323240680370692097,"November 02, 2020 at 02:28AM"

@jscarto,"No one would ever default to a plot like this. Yet with color, it is par for the course in many sciences.

Color (and more appropriately, luminance) is an axis. Like x- and y-axes, changes in luminance need to be consistent and non-random.
